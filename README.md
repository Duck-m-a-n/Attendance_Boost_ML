## Problem Overview:

GoalZone is a fitness club chain providing five types of fitness classes in Canada. 
After the COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted, the fitness classes schedule is back to normal. 
However, the customers have been complaining about having a hard time booking a fitness class. 
After initial analysis, the program operation team found out that the fitness classes are always fully booked but have a low attendance rate for each class.
To improve this situation, the team would like to increase the class capacity for customers to sign up if a low attendance rate is predicted.

## Problem Statement:

Problem Statement The operation manager has asked the team to answer the following questions: 
- Can the team predict the attendance rate for each fitness class? 
- How can the team use the predicted results to optimize the class capacity?

## Solution: 
The team will use machine learning to predict the attendance rate for each fitness class. 
The machine learning model will be trained on historical data to accurately predict the attendance rate. 
The team will then use the predicted results to optimize the class capacity. The team will set the capacity for each fitness class based on the predicted attendance
